Hello again!

ShellBot is a fancy docker wrapper. In essence, all of your commands get 
sent to a docker container that ShellBot manages by doing this:

    docker exec -t (the container) sh -c "(your command)"

I know what you're thinking: "Oh, I can just escape some quotes and execute
whatever I want!" but sadly no, this is not the case :( that's too easy!
